####Build a custom library for Apache&#174; Spark&trade; and deploy it to a Jupyter Notebook.

If you're new to developing Spark applications you've come to the right place. Our **Start Developing with Spark** tutorial provides detailed end-to-end steps that show you how to build a simple custom library for Spark (written in [scala](http://scala-lang.org/)) and how to deploy it on [IBM Analytics for Apache Spark for Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/apache-spark-starter/). These steps are the foundation for building real-life production applications.  You'll also learn how to manage your project with the import, test, and debug features of Scala IDE for Eclipse.
